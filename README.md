# Lifeband-vxOS-tLogger
tLogger is a logging library that can be used for data, contact events and localisation on ESP32 and ESP32c3. Events are logged with serial number and date time stamp.

This logging library is a lightweight Context & Event logger for IoT. It was built from scratch with an awareness that logging on microcontrollers is a complicated task, as well as the fact that these devices are often used for collecting data for process control or machine learning tasks. tLogger makes it simple to provide high quality and reliable logging to connected devices in the most complex environments by helping with resolving issues such as memory management problems and circular buffers.

tLogger provides a small footprint logging with various sources of Log data on the ESP32 and ESP32c3 - as Core, such as Ethernet-Core or Wi-Fi-core and standalone.
